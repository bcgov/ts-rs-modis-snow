Timing and Duration of Snow Cover in British Columbia
==================================================

### Overview

Analysis of a 500 m gridded raster of the onset, melt and duration of snow cover in British Columbia using the MODIS Snow Cover Product (Collection 6) between 2002-2018. 

### Project Status

This project is under active development.

### Goals/Roadmap

Explain interannual variability by exploring ocean-climate teleconnections, time, and terrain as predictors of the onset, melt and duration of snow by hydrologic zones.
